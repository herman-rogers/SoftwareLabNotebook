# SoftwareLabNotebook 

Notes from the software engineering laboratory

## What is this LabNotebook for?

Generally when working my way through software projects I ask a lot of questions and find a lot of answers.
Over the years - these answers can get lost requiring me to go back to original questions to find the
same answers again. This lab notebook is here to help prevent that.

It is also important throughout the day to note down ideas about architecture, concepts, and designs of systems
that can be useful to have a record of. Many times a day I'll have ideas on how to work a feature into a system
and forget what the exact implementation is at the end of the day.

LabNotebook is here to help sort out these issues and provide a permanent record for my software development.

## Guidelines

Putting these guidelines here is mostly for those using the notebook - best practices on keeping this notebook up
to date.

* Record the date on each page. Start each day on a new page.
* Label each entry and record this in a table of contents.
* Do not erase. Draw lines through deleted entries.
* Avoid backfilling. If you realize later that you left something out, or just want to summarize something,
go ahead and writ it in, noting that it's after-the-face.
* Include everything you contribute to ... the good, bad, and ugly.
