### Tech

#### Rewire - expose private functions for testing

To use rewire you first must install it `npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-rewire` into you dev dependencies.

> We're using babel-plugin-rewire rather than the original rewire project since it doesn't support imports

Next add babel-plugin-rewire to your .babelrc:

```json
{
  "presets": [
    ...
  ],
  "plugins": ["rewire", "transform-decorators-legacy"]
}
```

To use private functions you first need to import the rewire api:

```javascript
import { __RewireAPI__ as ModuleAPI } from './module';
```

Then call the private function by using the rewire api:

```javascript
const moduleFunction = TransformRewireAPI.__get__('modulePrivateFunction');
```
