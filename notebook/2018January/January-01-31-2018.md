#### Browser Push Notifications

Adding a browser push notification is fairly simple. Essentially all you need to do is:

```javascript
if(notification.sender['client-user-id']) {
  const title = `New message ${notification.sender.email}`;
  const content = {
    body: notification.message.text,
  };

  new Notification(title, content);
}
```

Basically we first check to see if a message was sent from a client (from someone other than the user of the current app). We then just create a title for the popup, some content to display, then use the browsers api to construct a new Notification with the data we want.
