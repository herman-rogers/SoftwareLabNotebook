#### Postgresql

To install postgresql from brew on Mac OS you can run the command

```
brew install postgresql
```

To install a specific command you can first search for the right version then run the command:

```
brew search postgresql

brew install postgresql@9.6
```

Another very handy way of installing postgres on to mac is to get the Postgres.app (from the dev over at heroku). This is by far the best way to install postgres. Sometimes homebrew will fail to link it up correctly, or provide correct permissions, etc.
