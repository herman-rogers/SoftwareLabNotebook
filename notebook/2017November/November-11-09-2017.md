### Continuous Integration

For mobile continuous integration we need to support three points of delivery - app store (production), beta users (beta), and staging environments for testing (staging).

This will require 1) several apps inside of itunes connect (one for beta / production the other for staging) and 2) Multiple xcode schemes to use to swap out the necessary environments.

We also need to have a consideration for the different environments we need to setup (to point the staging endpoints to)
