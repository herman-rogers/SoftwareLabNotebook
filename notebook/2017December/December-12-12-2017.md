#### Big O Notation

(Similar to the values of calculus) in big o analysis we take a look at the factors that make the largest and immediate impact upon the overall number.

For example, 45n^3 + 20n^2 + 19 = 47,019 (n = 10), in this equation the last two values only account for a fraction of the total while the first value accounts for 45,000. Thus we can write this in big o notation as O(N^3) throwing out the smaller values.

Types of big o algorithms:

O(1) - Constant time

public void addItemToArray(int item) {
   array[itemInArray++] = item;
}

O(N) - Linear time

O(N^2) - Linear time squared (bubble sort)

O(2^n) - denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles each additional input to the data set.

O(log N) - logarithmic time (binary search) - as the data set grows the time it takes to calculate does not 
increase dramatically. In the example of binary search this is because it halves the data set with each iteration essentially making the data set smaller and smaller.

O(n log N)
