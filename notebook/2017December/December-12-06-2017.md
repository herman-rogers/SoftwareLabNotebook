#### React Native App State

In React Native you can manage the app state (such as when its moved into the background). This is really handy for running certain events to manage state.

All you need to do is import ```AppState```, and add/listen to events.

```
componentDidMount() {
  AppState.addEventListener('change', this.handleAppState);
}

componentWillUnmount(){
  AppState.removeListener('change', this.handleAppState);
}

handleAppState(nextAppState) {
  if(nextAppState === 'active') {
    // App is active on phone
  }
  if(nextAppState.match(/inactive|background/)) {
    // App is either inactive or put into the background
  }
}
```
