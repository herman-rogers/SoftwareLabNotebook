### Work

#### Godot Cloud Editor

So godot can be compiled to WASM using the new tools released in version 3.0. Unfortunately there are a lot of issues with doing so, but the fact that we can do it at all is pretty awesome.

To get started you first need to clone the godot engine and compile it manually, you'll also need to install emscripten. To add emscripten to your path you need to run ```source ./emsdk_env.sh```, how to save this permanently I don't know (other than manually adding it to your env). So instructions on that are pending.

To compile the engine to WASM you'll need to run the command ```scons platform=javascript tools=yes target=release_debug``` the target can also be set to release, and probably will be once launched into production.

After that you'll need to setup the project to host the editor in the browser, which basically means just copying the files from ./bin and running it with python or node (i.e. python -m SimpleHTTPServer).
