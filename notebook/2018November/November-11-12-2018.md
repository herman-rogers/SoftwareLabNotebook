### Notes

#### Using Mozilla [http observatory](https://github.com/mozilla/http-observatory)

Http observatory allows you to check the headers you're serving to guarantee that your web applications are secure.
We are using them in this capacity to make sure that all of our web apps guarantee a secure policy to the end users.

Before your clone the repo make sure you have the prerequisites postgres and openssl installed. To do this on Mac OS run:

`
$ brew install postgres
$ brew install openssl
`

Next, to get started with http observatory clone the repo and change into the directory:

`
$ git clone https://github.com/mozilla/http-observatory.git
$ cd http-observatory
`

Then start up a new virtual env and install the apps dependencies:

`
$ virtualenv -p `which python3` env
$ source ./env/bin/activate
$ pip install psycopg2
$ pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
`

> You may also run pip3 here if you have both python 2 and 3 installed

After installing the dependencies you should be all set for scanning your http headers.

You can read more in the http-observatory repo README.md linked above
