## Creating FramerX integration

So basically FramerX is the bomb - it's a very cool way of integrating designers into your component flow and getting them to build components for you.

It's basically the promise land.

So how shall I integrate this into our project? Well basically we need to have components created by designers be added to the library we currectly use.
To do this we'll first create a design folder that will hold the framerx project and the go on from there.

Things to keep in mind is:

- We need to have documentation for the components
- We need to add the new components from framerx to src
- We need to reverse the above process, add components from src to framerx

Some other questions we need to ask is, can we compile from typescript to normal javascript? Can we use custom libraries? etc.

## Styled Components integration

The first thing we need to do after creation of the FramerX project is to see how we can leverage our current packages. Particularly styled-components.

What we need to find out is if framerx will obey our current package.json.
