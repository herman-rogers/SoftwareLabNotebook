### RxJS unit testing

Unit testing in RxJS can be very very tricky. Not only does it not follow the normal conventions of unit testing (import function, assert value, test value) there's also different types of unit testing to consider within the rxjs framework.

For example, Observers are tested using the TestScheduler while the Subjects are tested using a completely different paradigm (for this quick note I'll outline Observers but avoid Subjects).

To test an Observer you first need to understand what marble testing is (which can be read [in the official docs](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/blob/master/doc/marble-testing.md)). Essentially, marble testing is a way to represet time and data and at what time you're expecting a certain form of data. Basically, I expect an array with all numbers at 10 seconds and an array with only even numbers at 20 seconds (for a filtering example).

It's a fairly elegant - if not downright complex - concept to grasp but an example could look like:

```javascript
import { TestScheduler } from 'rxjs';
import { from } from 'rxjs/observable/from';

it('must run a test correctly', () => {
  const testScheduler = new TestScheduler((expected, actual) => {
    expect(actual).toEqual(expected);
  });

  const marble = '-x-y-z';
  const hotTest = testScheduler.createHotObservable(marble, {
    x: 1,
    y: 2,
    z: 5,
  });

  // Custom Algorithm
  const testEvent = test => from(test).filter(number => number % 2 === 0);
  const expectedValues = { x: 1, y: 2, z: 5 };
  const actual = testEvent(hotTest);

  testScheduler.expectObservable(actual).toBe('---y--', expectedValues);
  testScheduler.flush();
});
```
