## Notes

### Debugging iOS

* To get the debug logs directly off the device you can navigate to ~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/MobileDevice/<Device Name> to view all logs. You can delete erroneous ones.

* If you have a crash in a testflight build only it is likely related to the relase build. To test release builds on development machines go to Xcode > Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme and change the build configuration from Debug to Release

* Need to create a better strategy of keeping track of sockets and channels. Need to guarantee that sockets and channels are never duplicated and always closed when logging out, the app is closed, disabled, forced closed, or the sleep button is pressed. It'll be important to keep track of this throughout the entire app.
