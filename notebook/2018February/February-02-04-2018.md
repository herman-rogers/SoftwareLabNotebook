#### Debuggin node.js

To debug node.js all you need to do is run ```node --inspect app.js``` which will automatically attach the v8 debugger (which is now built into node). With that go to chrome and navigate to ```about:inspect``` and click on ```open dedicated DevTools for node```, this will take you to the typical chrome debugger. From here you can set breakpoints, step through code, etc just as you would a web client.
