#### Unreal Engine and Docker

To get the output of logs from a cook command you can always find them in /home/unreal/Library/Logs/Unreal\ Engine/LocalBuildLogs/Cook-2019.02.08-17.10.21.txt. (Or attempt uploaded with *)

It is also interesting to note that the folder nameing needs to be exactly consistent. For example, BloodFortress/BloodFortress.uproject needs to be in this format for cook to complete. (This could be a paticular case when sharing a folder through docker run command).

The supported platforms for UE4 are:

AllDesktop,
LinuxNoEditor,
Linux,
LinuxClient,
LinuxServer,
Android_ETC1,
Android_Multi,
Android_ASTC,
Android_ATC,
Android_ETC2,
Android,
Android_PVRTC,
Android_DXT,
HTML5,

Other Optional ones (although I'm not sure if its 100% supported out of the box):
WindowsNoEditor,
WindowsServer,
PS4,
XboxOne,
IOS

Turns out that these platforms are unsupported on Linux - only a Windows machine will do.

For the current state of things we'll first add in a Linux docker container and run builds from that. If demand for Windows increase then we'll have to setup a windows docker environment as well and figure out things from there.
