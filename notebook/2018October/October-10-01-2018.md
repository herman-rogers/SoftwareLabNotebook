### Ideas:

#### Building a window.crypto library

Basically the idea is that I need a crypto library that works in unit tests (so we can mimic the behavior of the browser spec).

I suppose theoretically it can be used for normal cryptography purpose but generally the idea is you use the browser (or a proper implementation) for that.

Plus it'd be a good deep dive into how some algorithms are implemented in the browser.

Some resources to get started:

[Web Spec crypto tests](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/tree/master/WebCryptoAPI)
[Missing spec inside of jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom/issues/1612)
[An example library (that is incomplete)](https://github.com/anvilresearch/webcrypto)
[Deprecated crypto lib by Netflix](https://github.com/Netflix/NfWebCrypto)
