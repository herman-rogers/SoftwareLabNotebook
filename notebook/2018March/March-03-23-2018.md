## Notes:

### Work

#### FixMyJS Vim

Just a quick note about Fixmyjs vim. Basically to get it to auto format you need it to find the eslint file, and this is fine if you have it in your project. However, if it is NOT working, it is most likely you need to init git into your repo first.

Usually I setup git for everything but sometimes I have a tiny app I'm tinkering on and haven't gotten around to it. If this is the case then Fixmyjs won't find your .eslint file (because it looks inside the .git dir - not sure if I agree with this) - so git init is needed.

The other alternative is to have it set to a global value which I'm definitely not about.
