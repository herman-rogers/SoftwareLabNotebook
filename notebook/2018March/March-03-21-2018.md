## Notes:

### Gamebuildr docker build steps

To build the Unreal Engine for docker (and thus make it useful for gamebuildr) the first step is setting up the zip folder.

First, clone unreal from git.

Next zip up the UnrealEngine folder (make sure the folder is exactly UnrealEngine) and then rename the zip to the Engine's version.

For example, UnrealEngine-4.17.2. This still decompresses the archive as UnrealEngine but allows us to tag specific versions inside of our storage system.
