### Work

#### Postgres and docker-compose

To expose a port of postgres to connect your local machine to (I connected through PGadmin), you'll first need to add a section in your docker-compose.yml that has the port you want to expose and the port that is being used inside the docker container:

```
ports:
  - "5433:5432"
```

In some cases, if 5432 isn't taken up on your machin, you can just do ```5432:5432```.

To connect to it via pgadmin all you need to do is add for the connection localhost, port, and any credentials you specified (this defauls to user: postgres and password empty).

Make sure not to connect to the docker containers ip address - as you'll be denied access.
