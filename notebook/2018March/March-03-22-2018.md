## Notes:

### Getting Started React Native

So I've already built a project with React Native but now I'm starting from scratch (for a different side project) and now it seems I've forgotten it all - so here I am to document it all!

First, to be a bit lazy, install ```npm install -g create-react-native-app``` and because I don't do this whole Expo shinannigans I just immediately eject it with ```npm run eject``` to create a standard React Native app. This way we can open it up inside of Xcode and do all the fancy things we need to.
