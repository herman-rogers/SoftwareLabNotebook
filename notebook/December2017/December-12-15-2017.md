#### Vim config for ESLint

To configure ESLint for vim you need a variety of things which can be found online (mostly by looking at syntastic).

However, what isn't mentioned a lot of the time is that you need global packages for eslint installed (this is what vim uses as a default).

For our current setup we need to run the command:

```
npm install -g eslint esling-config-airbnb eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y eslint-plugin-react babel-eslint
```

This should install all the needed packages for eslint globally to run eslint checks for Airbnb styles.

To debug this process just type the command

```
eslint /path/to/file.js
```
