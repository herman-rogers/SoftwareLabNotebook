## Notes:

### ESlint with Prettier

Prettier provides a simple way to format code alongside stronger linting practices (for example eslint). It handles all the simple spaces, line breaks, etc while also allowing to check for more complex rules like object destructuring (for a javascript example).

It's also easy to format an entire file by running:

`prettier --single-quote --write src/**/*`

Paired up with airbnb styles it makes for a very strong experience for the developer and for an entire team to sync up with styles.c
