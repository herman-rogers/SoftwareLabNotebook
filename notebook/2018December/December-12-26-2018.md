## Lab Notes:

### Poets Website

Data layout for the poets website will revolve around blog posts, projects, and publications. Since we're using 
Dynamo DB, and hence a nosql database, we can at least not worry about the data structure up front. Unfortunately we won't
be able to make the relationship with projects and publications either - which is a fine trade off at this point
(since our website client doesn't know the data she wants).

Layout for Data:
  - blog posts
  - projects
  - publication
