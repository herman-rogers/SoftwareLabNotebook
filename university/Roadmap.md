# University Roadmap

The purpose of this roadmap is just to keep track of the courses and things that I'm working on to further cement my computer science knowledge and ~rule the world~ complete a masters degree with Georgia Tech (that's the endgame). I speculate a year of computer science work shall put me in good stead to apply to the program (and hopefully my industry experience will be able to boost my application fingers crossed).

So without further ado, here's the roadmap so far:

[Introduction to Discrete Maths for Comp Sci](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/discrete-mathematics)

This is my first introductory course to get familiar with mathematics in computer science. It is comprised of the following courses taken in order:

- Mathematical Thinking in Computer Science
- Combinatorics and Probability
- Introduction to Graph Theory
- Number Theory and Cryptography
- And a project at the end (Delivery Problem)

[Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cryptocurrency)

- Admittedly this is just for funsies - I'm also making my way through the book by the same name.
